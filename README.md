# LoanIT
Management of loans, lenders and resources.


This project was carried out during my course in BTS Computer Services for Organizations.
It's a web app developed with HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
Database is in SQLite but can be convert to a MySql one.

The aim is simple. Administrators have access to a dashboard where they can manage a database of users (lenders and administrators), resources and loans. They can also view loan statistics or manage users.
Once an administrator has added a lender, he or she can lend any available resource or manage loans.
